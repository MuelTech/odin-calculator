# CALCULATOR

This is the final project of The Odin Project’s Foundations course — a fully functional calculator built with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.

It performs basic math operations and handles edge cases, including divide-by-zero and multiple operator inputs.

It also features keyboard support, input validation, and clean display management for a smooth user experience.
